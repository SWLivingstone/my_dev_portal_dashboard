# My Dev Portal

My Dev Portal is made with new developers in mind. It allows you to quickly and easily set up a public front-facing portfolio to showcase your projects and skills. As well, you will be able to track and log your job applications.

Aside from functioning as a portfolio and a job hunt management tool for new developers, My Dev Portal is also a great place to dive into the world of open source. As the public front-facing portfolios rely on themes for their layout, My Dev Portal allows for an unlimited number of new developers to add meaningful contributions in the form of new themes, while putting a pull request or two under their belt.

## Current State

My Dev Portal is up and running at http://mydevportal.io. Users are able to jump right in and create a public-facing portfolio that will be hosted at http://mydevportal.io/portfolio_name. Users can also use their dashboard to track and log all of their current and past job applications.

mydevportal.io is a permanent web app, so you need not worry about losing your portfolio or job tracking data.

*mydevportal.io is being reliably hosted on a premium Heroku server.*

## Want to Contribute?

First, check out the code of conduct [here](https://github.com/SWLivingstone/my_dev_portal/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).
Then, get crackin'!

As "My Dev Portal" is being built with new developers in mind, it is also being built to allow for entry-level contributions in the form of themes/templates. One can never have too many themes! Below you will find *very* detailed instructions on how to create a new Portfolio theme. Do not let the long-winded instructions fool you, as adding a theme is quite simple! The majority of the instructions are simply tables depicting the available user data.

**Designers Welcome**
If you have a great design for My Dev Portal that you would like made, submit it as an issue with a mockup, and someone will build it!

The standards for contribution are simple and minimal:
* If what you wrote is a function, please add an RSpec test for it (tests are not necessary for private/protected functions)
* Portfolio themes should be responsive (tests are not necessary for themes)
* Portfolio themes must support the available user preferences (listed below)
* If you are adding a larger feature, please do your best to consider edge cases
* This is for fun and experience, so please have fun and learn!

If there is a feature that you would like to add, please send me a quick email at scottwlivingstone@gmail.com to tell me a little bit about itâ€”I am more than happy to add additional features. As well, feel free to start working on the laundry list of features to be added, which can be found listed under Projects.

Also, if you fancy yourself a CSS wizard and a master of style, please feel free to update the look of any elements that you wish.

P.S. Pull requests to correct my spelling will also be accepted ;p

## Setting Up the Dev Environment

**Requirements:**
  * Rails 5.1.4
  * Ruby 2.3.5
  * Postgres
  * Bundler -v 1.15.2 (This is the version Heroku is currently using)

  1. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
  2. Run `rails db:setup` to set up the Postgres database
  3. Run `rails server` to start the server at localhost:3000

## Adding a New Theme

  1. Create a new template file in 'app/views/front_end/portfolios/themes'
  * The file name will be the theme name
  * The file extension must be html.haml
    * If you don't already know Haml it will take you less than 20 minutes to learn and save you hours in the long run. http://haml.info/tutorial.html
  2. Create a new stylesheet in app/assets/stylesheets/themes
  * Give it the same name as your theme
  * The file extension must be .scss
  3. Restart the server for the asset pipeline to pick up the new stylesheet and for the Themes initializer to pick up the template.

  The template is now selectable while logged into the My Dev Portal dashboard under the Portfolio Settings page.

  **IMPORTANT NOTES**

  * Name space your CSS by wrapping your entire theme in a div with the class name <your-theme>. Then, reference all calls in the CSS with that div. This will prevent styles from overlapping between themes.
    ```
    // mytheme.html.haml

    .mytheme
      .header
      .body
        .content
      .footer

    // mytheme.scss

    .mytheme .header {
      style
    }

    .mytheme .body {
      style
    }
    ```

  * Please make your theme -friendly
  * You shouldn't need to add any dependencies. Bootstrap 4, Sass, and jQuery are supported, and with the fantastic addition of CSS Grid, you should be able to manage without adding further dependencies.
  * Feel free to create reusable partials in app/views/portfolios/components. As well, feel free to use any of the existing components in there. You should be able to drop them straight into your theme with 
  `= render partial: 'portfolios/components/some_component'`
